â€‹To understand this problem let's take an example:

Input: head = [1,2,10,20,30,40,5], left = 3, right = 6
Output: [1,2,40,30,20,10,5]
So, first of all I would like to show you if we do reverse one-by-one then, how it'll gonna looks like

Now, let's talk about how we gonna achieve this result,

So, for that we gonna use 3 pointers:

Pre
Curr
Forw
So, the pre pointer will be assigned on just before left position
Curr pointer & forw pointer will help in reversing the linkedlist

So, we gonna perform these steps,
curr.next = forw.next
forw.next = curr.next ? prev.next ["We are not sure at this point which one forw should have to point, so we gonna find out later"]
prev.next = forw
forw = curr.next
Step-1 : Assign the pointers at their positions

Step-2 :

Curr will point to 30 i.e. 10 --> 30
forw will point to curr i.e. 20 --> 10
pre will point to forw i.e. 2 --> 20
image
Step-3 :

Curr will point to 40 i.e. 10 --> 40
forw will point to just after prev i.e. 30 --> 20 [Now at this point it's get clear our forw will point to just after prev]
pre will point to forw i.e. 2 --> 30
image
Step-4 :

Curr will point to 5 i.e. 10 --> 5
forw will point to just after prev i.e. 40 --> 30
pre will point to forw i.e. 2 --> 40

Now, ladies-n-gentlemen everything is absolutely clear I hope so.

Oops, one more thing I forgot to add and i.e. is we gonna use dummy list! Now you ask why?

Because, let's say we have given "left = 1" then where our prev pointer will be assigned then, 
to handle that case we gonna use one dummy node. So, if left = 1 then our prev will be at dummy node
Let's look at the code,

Java

class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0); // created dummy node
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy; // intialising prev pointer on dummy node
        
        for(int i = 0; i < left - 1; i++)
            prev = prev.next; // adjusting the prev pointer on it's actual index
        
        ListNode curr = prev.next; // curr pointer will be just after prev
        // reversing
        for(int i = 0; i < right - left; i++){
            ListNode forw = curr.next; // forw pointer will be after curr
            curr.next = forw.next;
            forw.next = prev.next;
            prev.next = forw;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
