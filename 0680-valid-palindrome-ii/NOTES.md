This is a Java class named Solution which has two methods: checkPalindrome and validPalindrome. The checkPalindrome method is a helper function that checks if a given substring of the input string s is a palindrome or not. The validPalindrome method checks if the input string s can be a valid palindrome by removing at most one character.
​
checkPalindrome(String s, int l, int r):
​
Input: A string s, and two integer pointers, l and r, representing the starting and ending indices of the substring that needs to be checked for palindrome.
Output: A boolean value, true if the substring is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
This method uses a while loop to check if the characters at the l and r positions are the same. If they are not, it returns false. Otherwise, it increments l and decrements r until l is greater than or equal to r. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it returns true.
validPalindrome(String s):
​
Input: A string s.
Output: A boolean value, true if the input string can be a valid palindrome by removing at most one character, and false otherwise.
This method initializes two pointers, l at the start of the string, and r at the end of the string. It then uses a while loop to check if the characters at the l and r positions are the same. If they are not, it calls the checkPalindrome method to check if the substring can be a palindrome by removing either the character at position l or the character at position r. If either of these calls returns true, it returns true. Otherwise, it increments l and decrements r until l is greater than or equal to r. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it returns true.
This class can be used to determine if a given string can be converted into a palindrome by removing at most one character.
